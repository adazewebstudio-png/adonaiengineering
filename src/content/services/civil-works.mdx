# Overview

**Adonai Engineering and Construction Ltd** delivers civil works and development-linked infrastructure services that support buildings, estates, and urban growth projects.

Our civil works capability is focused on infrastructure associated with property development and urban expansion, delivered through disciplined execution, technical oversight, and structured project controls.

## Scope of Civil Works

### Estate & Access Roads
We construct internal estate roads and access roads that support residential and commercial developments, ensuring durability, proper drainage, and safe circulation within project sites.

### Urban & Development-Linked Roads
We undertake road works associated with urban development and property projects, delivered directly or through specialist partnerships depending on scale and technical requirements.

### Drainage Systems
We deliver drainage infrastructure designed to manage surface water effectively and protect developments from flooding and erosion, integrated with surrounding road and site works.

### Earthworks & Site Formation
We carry out earthworks, grading, and site formation works to prepare land for construction, ensuring stable platforms for buildings and infrastructure.
