# Why Project Controls Matter in Large Developments

The difference between a profitable project and a failed one often lies in **controls**. In the complex environment of large-scale estate development, hope is not a strategy.

## The Adonai Discipline

We employ a rigorous framework of controls:
1.  **Schedule Management**: Critical Path Method (CPM) scheduling to identify bottlenecks before they happen.
2.  **Cost Tracking**: Real-time variance analysis to keep budgets aligned.
3.  **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive identification of supply chain risks.

## The Result

Predictability. Our clients know exactly where their project stands, every week, without excuses.
